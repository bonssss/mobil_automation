# Appium Mobile Automation Tests (Python)

This repository contains test cases and examples. The course provides in-depth knowledge of mobile automation testing using **Appium** and **Python**. It covers a wide range of topics, from setting up the Appium environment to writing both basic and advanced mobile tests for Android and iOS applications.

## Course Overview

This course provides step-by-step instructions to learn mobile automation testing using Appium and Python. You will gain hands-on experience writing automation tests for real-world mobile applications across both **Android** and **iOS** platforms. The course also explores advanced techniques, such as handling mobile gestures, automating hybrid apps, and integrating tests into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Highlights

- **Setting up Appium and Python:** Learn how to set up the Appium server, install the necessary tools, and configure your environment for both Android and iOS testing.
- **Writing Mobile Automation Tests:** Write tests for Android and iOS applications, interacting with UI elements such as buttons, text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes, and more.
- **Advanced Automation Techniques:** Learn how to perform complex mobile gestures (swipe, zoom, etc.), handle popups, and automate hybrid applications with webviews and native components.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate Appium tests into your CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab.

## Features

- **Basic Tests:**
  - Verify app installation, launch, and interactions with simple UI elements (buttons, text inputs).
  
- **Intermediate Tests:**
  - Handle interactions with dropdowns, checkboxes, scrollable lists, and other UI components.
  
- **Advanced Tests:**
  - Implement tests for swipe, pinch, zoom, and multi-finger gestures.
  - Automate testing for hybrid apps (webview + native context).
  - Handle alerts, popups, and notifications in mobile apps.

- **Appium & Python Setup:**
  - A script to set up your Appium environment and install necessary dependencies (Appium, Selenium, etc.).
  - Example configurations for running tests on Android emulators, real devices, and iOS simulators.

- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Instructions for integrating Appium tests into CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated testing.

## Getting Started

To get started with running tests locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Appium**: You need Appium installed on your machine. You can install it via npm:
  ```bash
  npm install -g appium
